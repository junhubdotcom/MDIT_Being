# Being Agent Workflow Changes Summary
Date: September 17, 2025

## Overview
Modified the Being emotional tracking agent system to implement a coordinator workflow where the buddy agent remains the main controller and uses sub-agents as services rather than transferring control to them.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Main Agent (agent.py)
**BEFORE:** Used sub-agents with transfer_to_agent mechanism
**AFTER:** Uses tools directly with coordinator pattern

**Key Changes:**
- Changed from using `journal_agent, mood_agent` as sub-agents to importing their individual tools
- Modified imports to: `from .subagent.journal_agent import summarize_text, save_diary`
- Modified imports to: `from .subagent.mood_agent import analyze_sentiment, append_mood_point`
 - Standardized on `model="gemini-2.0-flash"` using Google AI Studio; removed Ollama/LiteLLM references
- Updated instruction to focus on tool usage instead of agent delegation
- Changed `tools=[]` to `tools=[summarize_text, save_diary, analyze_sentiment, append_mood_point]`
- Changed `sub_agents=[mood_agent, journal_agent]` to `sub_agents=[]`

**New Workflow Instructions:**
1. **Primary Role**: Chat with empathy and reflection
2. **Diary Requests**: Use summarize_text() → save_diary() → analyze_sentiment() → append_mood_point() → respond to user
3. **Pessimistic Content**: Use analyze_sentiment() → append_mood_point() → suggest precautionary actions if needed
4. **Response Pattern**: Always respond directly to user after using tools
5. **Safety**: Never provide medical diagnosis, recommend professional help for severe cases

### 2. Journal Agent (subagent/journal_agent.py)
**BEFORE:** Standalone agent for handling diary requests
**AFTER:** Service agent with exposed tools for main agent

**Key Changes:**
- Model set to "gemini-2.0-flash"
- Updated instruction to be service-oriented: "You are JournalAgent - a service for the Being Buddy agent"
- Modified to work as a service that doesn't chat directly with users
- Added structured response format requirements
- Tools `summarize_text` and `save_diary` are now exposed for import by main agent

### 3. Mood Agent (subagent/mood_agent.py)
**BEFORE:** Standalone agent for sentiment analysis
**AFTER:** Service agent with exposed tools for main agent

**Key Changes:**
- Model still set to "gemini-2.0-flash" (commented out LiteLLM)
- Updated instruction to be service-oriented: "You are MoodAgent - a service for the Being Buddy agent"
- Added specific response formats for different mood levels:
  - Normal: "Mood analysis: [emotions] (score: [score]). Mood logged successfully."
  - Concerning (< -0.7): "ALERT: Concerning mood detected..."
  - Urgent (< -0.9): "URGENT: Severe mood concern..."
- Tools `analyze_sentiment` and `append_mood_point` are now exposed for import by main agent

### 4. Import Structure (__init__.py)
**BEFORE:** Exported journal_agent and mood_agent objects
**AFTER:** Fixed import reference from `mode_agent` to `mood_agent`

**Key Changes:**
- Corrected `from .mood_agent import mode_agent` to `from .mood_agent import mood_agent`
- Updated `__all__` to properly reference `mood_agent`

## Workflow Comparison

### OLD WORKFLOW (Transfer-based):
1. User talks to buddy_agent
2. Buddy_agent transfers control to journal_agent or mood_agent
3. Sub-agent handles request and responds to user
4. Control remains with sub-agent

### NEW WORKFLOW (Coordinator-based):
1. User talks to buddy_agent
2. Buddy_agent uses tools (summarize_text, save_diary, analyze_sentiment, append_mood_point)
3. Buddy_agent processes tool results
4. Buddy_agent responds directly to user with insights
5. Buddy_agent remains in control throughout

## Technical Architecture

### Models Used:
- **Main Agent**: Google AI Studio, model: gemini-2.0-flash
- **Sub-agents**: Still configured for Gemini (but not used in new workflow)

### Tools Available to Main Agent:
1. `summarize_text(conversation: str)` - Creates diary summaries
2. `save_diary(user_id: str, summary: str)` - Persists diary entries
3. `analyze_sentiment(text: str)` - Analyzes emotional content
4. `append_mood_point(user_id: str, date_iso: str, score: float)` - Tracks mood timeline

## Expected User Experience

### Diary Request Example:
1. User: "Please save today's conversation as a diary entry"
2. Buddy uses tools: summarize_text → save_diary → analyze_sentiment → append_mood_point
3. Buddy responds: "I've saved your diary entry [details] and analyzed your mood [insights]"

### Pessimistic Content Example:
1. User: "I'm feeling really sad and anxious today"
2. Buddy uses tools: analyze_sentiment → append_mood_point
3. Buddy responds with empathy and suggests precautionary actions if mood score is concerning

## Status
- ✅ Code changes implemented
- ✅ Removed Ollama integration for a simpler, single-provider setup
- ✅ Coordinator pattern established
- ⚠️ Testing needed to verify workflow functions as expected
- ⚠️ Sub-agent models still on Gemini (not critical since main agent handles everything)

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Run `adk run agent` to test the new coordinator workflow
2. Test diary saving functionality
3. Test mood analysis with various emotional inputs
4. Verify buddy agent maintains control and responds appropriately
